For those that donâ€™t, understanding the development process will still be beneficial. As Java is a cross platform language as well as the language of choice for mobile development, the language is especially important to learn."

                              I wanted to make something similar to a project that I find is a really good conection of a lot of the intrductory parts of a language, Pokemon, a very very simplified version of pokemon. This requires the user to select two Pokemon, then 4 moves for each Pokemon. This gives a really good idea for how file input and output works as well as classes and inheritance as it requres at least 3 classes with the base Pokemonclass that holds all of the base stats. A Move class which holds all of the move stats and name. Finally a UserPokemon class that inherites from Pokemon and adds a vector of 4 moves and adds a current health (could be expanded to hold current stats.

                              This was an interesting but not that challenging project. We were tasked with making a simple slot game as a way of randomizing strings based on simple percentages. The video included shows much of the aproach took but it was. One of the weird spots I ran into while working on this assignment was the strange stats compared to what should be expected from a slot game (giving the user way too many chances of winning).

                              A card game that was made based off of a previous assignment using Java's Swing library. The game is ment to allow the user to select a card and then a pile of cards, it would then verify if the card is playable (the card is one number value above or below the card last played on that pile), then the AI will run it's turn. If both are can not play new hands are delt untill the deck runs out of card.
